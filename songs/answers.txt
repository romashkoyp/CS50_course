For understanding the list of 100 songs I exported this list to a special service https://soundiiz.com/
After that, I saved the songs in a Spotify list and analyzed this playlist with another service https://www.chosic.com/spotify-playlist-analyzer/

To improve the Audio Aura concept, I would do the following things:
- Expand the list of 100 songs to 1000 or more
- Analyze the lyrics of songs using AI tools like ChatGPT
- Analyze tempo and genres
I think this approach is better than Audio Aura because it considers more parameters.
