Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: 10 and 100 simulations yielded incorrect results for the top 3 winners

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: running 1000 simulations is sufficient, as the final results for the first 3 winners do not change with an increase in the number of simulations
